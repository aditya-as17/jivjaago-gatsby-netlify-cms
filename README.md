# Start publishing

It's time to create your first blog post. Login to your site's /admin/ page and create a new post by clicking New Blog. Add a title, a date and some text. When you click Publish, a new commit will be created in your GitHub repo with this format Create Blog “year-month-date-title”.

Then Netlify will detect that there was a commit in your repo, and will start rebuilding your project. When your project is deployed you'll be able to see the post you created.



### Media Libraries (installed, but optional)

Media Libraries have been included in this starter as a default. If you are not planning to use `Uploadcare` or `Cloudinary` in your project, you **can** remove them from module import and registration in `src/cms/cms.js`. Here is an example of the lines to comment or remove them your project.

```javascript
import CMS from "netlify-cms-app";
// import uploadcare from 'netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare'
// import cloudinary from 'netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary'

import AboutPagePreview from "./preview-templates/AboutPagePreview";
import BlogPostPreview from "./preview-templates/BlogPostPreview";
import ProductPagePreview from "./preview-templates/ProductPagePreview";
import IndexPagePreview from "./preview-templates/IndexPagePreview";

// CMS.registerMediaLibrary(uploadcare);
// CMS.registerMediaLibrary(cloudinary);

CMS.registerPreviewTemplate("index", IndexPagePreview);
CMS.registerPreviewTemplate("about", AboutPagePreview);
CMS.registerPreviewTemplate("products", ProductPagePreview);
CMS.registerPreviewTemplate("blog", BlogPostPreview);
```

Note: Don't forget to also remove them from `package.json` and `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json` using `yarn` or `npm`. During the build netlify-cms-app will bundle the media libraries as well, having them removed will save you build time.
Example:

```
yarn remove netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare
```

OR

```
yarn remove netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary
```
